## Jekyll boilerplate ðŸ‘‡

## Maptime Starter site

Hosting your own Maptime chapter website? **Starter** is a simple Jekyll theme that's designed to be forked and tweaked to suit your needs. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sitesâ€”and it's the software that will generate your Maptime chapter's site.


### Getting started

* If we've finished onboarding your new chapter into the Maptime organization, then should already have *Starter* cloned into the `gh-pages` branch of your chapter repo and have been given you privileges to push to it.  Please skip ahead and begin to customize your site.  

* Not yet in the Maptime fold?  Fill out [this form](http://maptime.io/start/#start-form) and we'll get you set up!

In either case, once your repository has been cloned in to the Maptime organization, your site will be hosted at `http://maptime.io/<chapter>` where `chapter` is the name of your chapter's repository.


### Customizing your site

Once you have access to your chapter's repository, you're free to customize the site, including its settings. The site's configuration file is [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file, which is a [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file. Here's a rundown of the configuration options:


#### Top-level configuration

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `baseurl` | Yes | URL path | This sets the part of the site's URL after `maptime.io`, like `/dc` or `/philadelphia`. It's typically the name of your chapter repository. |
| `permalink` | No | Jekyll permalink style or template | This sets how URLs are generated by Jekyll. See [the Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) for details on choosing a permalink style. If you're unsure, then `pretty` is a good choice. |
| `markdown` | No | Markdown render | This chooses how Markdown is turned into HTML. Most chapters don't need to change this setting. |
| `paginate` | Yes | Number of posts on the front page | _Starter_ supports pagination. Change this value to choose the number of posts on a page. |
| `repo` | Yes | Name of the repository on GitHub | For example, the name of the _Starter_ repo is `starter`. |
| `github_org` | Yes | Name of the organization or username on GitHub | Typically, this is set to `maptime`. |


#### `maptime:` section configuration

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chapter` | Yes | Maptime chapter name |
| `twitter` | No | Maptime chapter's Twitter username | If your Maptime chapter has a Twitter account, put its user name here. Don't include the `@` character. |
| `disqus` | No | Disqus account name | _Starter_ optionally supports comments on posts with [Disqus](http://disqus.com). To enable comments, create a Disqus account for the chapter site and fill this field with the account name. |


### Creating an event or post

_Starter_ supports two kinds of content: events and posts. Events are for your chapter's meetings and posts are for general blog content. To create a post or event:

1. In the `_posts` directory, create a new Markdown file. Name the file in the pattern of `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, where *YYYY-MM-DD* is the date of the event or post and *slug* is a short, unique identifier for the event or post. For example, a post dated January 1, 2016 entitled "Mappy New Year" might be named `2016-01-01-mappy-new-year.md`.

2. At the top of the Markdown file, add *front matter* for your content type. Each post or event needs some extra information at the top of the file called [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). The front matter determines what kind of content it is and other settings, like authorship or RSVP information. See the next section, _Content types_, for a listing of front matter options.

   Here's example front matter for a post:

   ```
   ---
   layout: post
   title: Oceanographic Maps
   author: Marie Tharp
   ---
   ```

3. Beneath the front matter, write your post or event text. You can format your text using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). For example:

   ```
   Check out the *unusual* features of the __ocean floor__ in this map ofâ€¦
   ```

4. Preview your work. In a terminal session, run `jekyll serve` from the root directory of this repository. Jekyll will generate the site and provide you with a URL to open in a browser to see your work.

   **Note**: If you get a `command not found` error, Jekyll may not be installed. See Jekyll's [installation instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to get up and running.

5. Once you're satisfied with your new event or post, commit the Markdown file to the repository and push to GitHub.

   **Note**: If you're using multiple branches, only those changes merged to the `gh-pages` branch will appear on the Maptime site.

In a few minutes, your post appears on the Maptime chapter site!


### Content Types

_Starter_ supports two types of content: events and posts. Here's the front matter for each content type:


#### Event
Events are for planned meetups with RSVP information. Note that date used in the file name for the event should match the date of the event itself (for example, an event to be held on January 4, 2016 would have `2016-01-04` as its date in the file name).

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layout` | Yes | `event` | This value should always be `event`. |
| `category` | Yes | `event` | This value should always be `event`. |
| `title` | Yes | Event title |
| `rsvp` | Yes | URL to RSVP | This should be a URL to an [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com) or other service event page. |


#### Post

Posts are like blog posts. These are great for meetup follow-ups or posts that don't have a meetup event tied to it.

| Name | Required | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `layout` | Yes | `post` | This value should always be `post`. |
| `title` | Yes | Title of your post |
| `author` | No | Author's name |
| `image` | No | URL path to an image | An image added here will show up as a [Twitter card](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) when a post is shared. |


### Getting help

- If you're having a problem, [create an issue](https://github.com/maptime/maptime-admin/issues) on the [maptime/maptime-admin](https://github.com/maptime/maptime-admin/) repository and we'll respond to it.
- The site is powered by Jekyll. To make custom tweaks to your own site, you should read [Jekyll's documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
- _Starter_ makes the assumption you will be running the site on GitHub Pages (i.e., on the `gh-pages` branch of your repository). See [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) for more information about using GitHub Pages.
