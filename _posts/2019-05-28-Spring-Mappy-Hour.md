**Date**: May 28 2019

**Place**: Mount Vernon Marketplace, 520 Park Ave Baltimore MD 21201

It's been a while since we had a mappy happy hour, so let's meet up at Mt. Vernon Marketplace and talk about our upcoming historical Open Street Car mapping project, OSM at Baltimore Data Day, and other exciting topics. We'll probably be in the back of the space and will post signs. See you then!
