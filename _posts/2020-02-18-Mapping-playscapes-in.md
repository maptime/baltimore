**Date**: February 18 2020

**Place**: Zen West, 5916 York Rd Baltimore MD 21212

Come join us at Zen West to continue mapping playgrounds and play areas in Baltimore. All are welcome, including first-timers new to OSM and Maptime. Bring a laptop if you have one, if not you can share with someone too. OSM mapping is easier with a mouse, but works okay with a trackpad if you don't have a mouse. We will focus on completing the playground mapping Task on the OSM US Task Manager: https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/project/160

Let's map all the play areas and play deserts in Baltimore!
