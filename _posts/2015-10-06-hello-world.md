are written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
We are the Baltimore Chapter of [Maptime](maptime.io)! Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.

Find us on [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeBmore/) and get to know other mappers in the Baltimore area.
