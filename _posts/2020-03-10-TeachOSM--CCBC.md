**Date**: March 10 2020

**Place**: CCBC Catonsville, 800 S Rolling Rd Catonsville MD 21228

Join us as we work with the CCBC Catonsville GIS Capstone course to learn about how OSM integrates many aspects of GIS technology. This meetup will be in collaboration with CCBC GIS professors and the GIS class. We will start with a short presentation about how OSM intersects with topics covered in GIS instruction, including: digitizing, databases/schemas, metadata, data quality, aerial image interpretation, and web GIS. We will then alternate between OSM US and HOT OSM tasking managers to work on important mapping tasks and to understand different map data requirements around the world that OSM can tackle.

Finally, we will demonstrate several ways to download OSM data and load them into a GIS desktop app for visualization or analysis.

Participants new to OSM are encouraged to sign up for an OSM account ahead of time and take the short online tutorial for using the in-browser iD editor. https://learnosm.org/en/beginner/

Food will be provided.
