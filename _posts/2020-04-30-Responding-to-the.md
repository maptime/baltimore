**Date**: April 30 2020

**Place**: Online event

If you are looking for a way to contribute to the effort to flatten the COVID19 curve and help keep your local businesses afloat, Maptime B'more has you covered. We are partnering with OpenStreetMap US on a mapathon to update OSM points of interest, for example the details for restaurants and other businesses, during the COVID19 Stay at Home Order. Some creative people have been putting together lists, like curbside and takeout options, and we want to make sure that they are reflected in OpenStreetMap, to better inform the public about what options are where!

Not familiar with editing OpenStreetMap? No problem it's really easy, and learning resources will be provided!

We will be having a virtual gathering over Zoom, with an alternative call in phone number. The Zoom details are revealed to those that sign up. The call in phone number and Zoom passwords will be e-mailed the day of.
