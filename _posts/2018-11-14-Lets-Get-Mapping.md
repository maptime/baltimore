**Date**: November 14 2018

**Place**: University of Baltimore Law School, 1401 North Charles St. Baltimore MD

Hey Maptimers, let's make some maps! Come join us at UB on National GISDay, Wednesday November 14th, to kick off some new mapping projects for Baltimore. We've got a bunch of interesting ideas for mapping projects we want to get started and we want you to come help. Bring your ideas, your datasets, your energy! If you have a laptop computer and need help downloading GIS datasets and software we can help with that too.

We will provide the space and light snacks. There are plenty of places nearby for food. Further instructions about parking and finding us inside the 11 W. Mt Royal building to follow.

Check out the minutes from our last meeting to learn more about some of the projects we want to talk about, https://github.com/maptimebmore/meeting-minutes
