Thanks to everyone that has expressed interested in participating in the Baltimore Data Day OpenStreetMap Hackathon!

I am hosting an open, drop-in-anytime OSM training at the University of Baltimore on July 8th from 6-9pm for anyone that couldn't join us at R. House on June 25th. This will be an opportunity for all of us to continue to familiarize ourselves with the iD editor and to identify neighborhoods and themes we would be interested in working on at Baltimore Data Day on July 12th.

Join us on the 8th if you're interested in serving as a participant or volunteer mentor at Baltimore Data Day, or, if you can't make it on the 12th and still want to participate in some OSM editing!

Please bring a laptop- there will be secure Wifi. I will also have some food and drinks for everyone. Feel free to stay the full 3 hours or stop by when your schedule permits!

Parking is free on the street after 6pm and there are tons of public transportation options in the area, including the MTA, MARC-Penn Station, and the Circulator.

Below is some information about Baltimore Data Day and the Hackathon on July 12th. Hope to see you there!

Baltimore Data Day (BDD) is a free annual event hosted by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance at the University of Baltimore. This summer will be our 10th year hosting this event which is open to community organizations, non-profits, city agencies, researchers, students, and residents. BDD is a good opportunity to network in the city around topic areas such as transportation, housing, crime, education, quantitative data, and GIS.

The 2019 event will be held on Friday, July 12th at the University of Baltimore. At the event will be hosting a casual lunchtime/afternoon (12-2pm) workshop on OpenStreetMap where we can bring together GIS professionals and Baltimore City residents to add community assets to the OSM platform. Our goal is to ensure that all neighborhoods in the city are richly represented.
