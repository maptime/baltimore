We will be meeting in the Center for the Build Environment and Infrastructure Studies (CBEIS) building at 5201 Perring Parkway, Room 257.

Join us for a GIS Lab session, demonstration, and talks at the Morgan State University Center for Advanced Transportation and Infrastructure Engineering (CATIER) lab in the Institute of Urban Research: https://www.morgan.edu/iur

There is a visitor parking lot on Perring Parkway- the CE Lot- and it is located next to the CBEIS building on Perring. There is a $0.50/hour charge to park. DO NOT park in the garage, it is impossible to get out without a student ID (ask Cheryl K. about the time she got trapped!). Street parking may be available but read the signs to ensure you are not ticketed.
