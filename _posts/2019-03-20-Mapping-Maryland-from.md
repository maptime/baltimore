**Date**: March 20 2019

**Place**: George Peabody Library, 17 E Mt Vernon Pl Baltimore MD 21202

Join us for a special tour of the Willard Hackerman collection of Maryland maps at the George Peabody Library. Learn about the collection, William Hackerman, GIS at Hopkins, and other Sheridan Libraries resources from curators Jim Gillispie and Paul Espinosa.

From colonial impressions of the Chesapeake Bay to detailed city plans for guiding Baltimore's rapid expansion, this exhibition features over thirty of the most stunning and historically significant maps of Maryland from the collection of the late businessman, philanthropist, and Johns Hopkins alumnus Willard Hackerman. The maps are brought together with related rare books and prints, ephemera, and digital story maps to reveal the passion of a collector, the early mapping of Maryland, and the potential of combining historical maps with modern data to re-examine the past. Highlights include John Ogilby's "Lord Baltimore Map" from 1671, a hand-colored edition of Thomas H. Poppleton's 1822 "Plan of the City of Baltimore," and engraved views of Baltimore from the Harry N. Baetjer Collection of Historical Maps and Prints.
