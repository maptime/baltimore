At this 11th Annual Baltimore Data Day, we will be hosting sessions and workshops all week! Community leaders, nonprofit organizations, governmental entities and civic-minded technologists can come together to see the latest trends in community-based data and learn how other groups are using data to support and advance constructive change. Baltimore Data Week is structured around a series of “how-to” interactive workshops in which people who work with data will explain what data is available, where to find and access data, and how data can be actionable for communities.
