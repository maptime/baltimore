**Date**: October 30 2019

**Place**: Advocates For Children & Youth, 1 N Charles St #2400 Baltimore MD 21201

Playgrounds and rec-centers are important for kids, parents, and communities. Advocates for Children and Youth (https://www.acy.org/) wants to make sure that all children in Baltimore and Maryland have equitable access to playgrounds in their neighborhood. MaptimeBmore is partnering with ACY for an OSM mapathon this month to map missing playgrounds and rec-centers in Baltimore. With OSM, we hope to identify "play-deserts" - communities that are lacking in safe, walkable access to playgrounds and rec-centers.

Join us at ACY's headquarters in downtown Baltimore for a fun mapathon to help us add missing playgrounds to the Map!

ACY's office is at One N. Charles Street Suite 2400, Baltimore, MD 21201.

Food will be provided.

Please bring your laptop if you have one, if not feel free to team up with another member.
