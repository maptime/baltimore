**Date**: June 25 2019

**Place**: R. House, 301 W 29th St Baltimore MD 21211

Baltimore Data Day (BDD) is a free annual event hosted by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance at the University of Baltimore. This summer will be our 10th year hosting this event which is open to community organizations, non-profits, city agencies, researchers, students, and residents. BDD is a good opportunity to network in the city around topic areas such as transportation, housing, crime, education, quantitative data, and GIS.

The 2019 event will be held on Friday, July 12th at the University of Baltimore. At the event will be hosting a casual afternoon workshop on OpenStreetMap where we can bring together GIS professionals and Baltimore City residents to add community assets to the OSM platform. Our goal is to ensure that all neighborhoods in the city are richly represented. We will have an opportunity at the end of the conference to share with the group all of the kinds of edits and additions made to the map during the day.

This event on June 25th at R. House is for anyone interested in learning how to use and edit OpenStreetMap and to gauge interest in participating in the July BDD event. Feel free to join us, even if you aren't able to join us for Baltimore Data Day- all additions and edits are good edits, regardless of when they happen!

Agenda for June 25th at R. House:
1. Discuss our familiarity levels with OSM
2. Explore OSM: Sign up for an account, check out what features are already on the map in Baltimore
3. Discuss participation in Baltimore Data Day event

Please bring a laptop & an interested friend!
