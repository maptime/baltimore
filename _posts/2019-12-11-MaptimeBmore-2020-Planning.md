Wow! We had a great year and a ton of great events. But what is in store for MaptimeBmore in 2020? Come help us figure that out! Instead of a map / hack, this event will be more administrative to focus on planning events for 2020 and beyond, and to talk budgets and sponsorships.

All are still welcome. The MaptimeBmore organizers aren't leaving, but we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to be involved and to get mappy in Bmore.

First round of drinks for any Maptimer is on Jonathan!

Or, if you just want to come and talk about maps, OSM, your favorite spatial database, and tech, that is okay too! 😁🌎
