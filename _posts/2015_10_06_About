title: About Maptime Baltimore
---

Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone
 interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, 
 exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.
Our Baltimore Chapter is a continuation of the Geomore meetup, but
with new and exciting resources that come with an international network
of Maptime chapters!
