**Date**: January 22 2020

**Place**: 4709 Harford Rd, 4709 Harford Rd Baltimore MD 21214

Hey Maptimers, we need to change this one up a bit. With a long break and lots of sick family and runny noses, I'm not ready to pick back up the streetcar project yet. We will still be at Function in Lauraville, but we are re-purposing this event as a general meetup to work on personal projects or just do some OSM mapping. We do need to finish our Playground OSM Task, so that would be a good thing to work on. https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/project/160

Bring some cash or Venmo app for food. I'll try to get something other than pizza this time!

Sorry for the last minute change. Thayer and I are both excited to get back to the streetcar project, life just get's busy some times!

Location:
Function Coworking Community space
4709 Harford Rd Baltimore, MD 21214

It is half a block north of Moravia Ave on the east (right) side of the street, and the 2nd building south of Rosekemp Ave. Open Street Map still has the building as its previous tenant, the American Beauty Academy. It has been completely remodeled and is a very nice space.

Parking:
There is ample free street parking at that time of day, the PayToPark meter period ends at 6pm. The closest bus routes are the 54 (Harford) and 28 (Harford at Moravia). Note that the 54 bus approximates the route of the old #19 streetcar.
