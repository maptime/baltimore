**Place**: Online event

Dear Maptimers,

You've probably seen a lot of emails recently from Meetup about reclaiming the MaptimeBmore Meetup account.

Over many months, the MaptimeBmore organizing team - Jonathan, Cheryl, Thayer, Camille, and several other members - have made the decision to move off the Meetup platform to other free systems.

MaptimeBmore isn't going away, we are just moving off of Meetup.   Meetup costs about $200 per year and requires a credit card on-file for renewal.  While Meetup says there are over 300 of you mappers, we can't keep shaking down the same few of you over and over to pay this fee.  So we are letting the Meetup account expire and using its system to send you this last message.

Please sign up to our next event on Eventbrite [https://www.eventbrite.com/o/maptime-bmore-64433266583](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/maptime-bmore-64433266583), and stay tuned there for more events.

Thanks for the continued support, see you on the next platform and at the next event. [July 20th Mappy Hour at R.House](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/maptime-bmore-july-2023-mappy-hour-tickets-659169492697?aff=ebdsoporgprofile)
