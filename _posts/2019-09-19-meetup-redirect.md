We are the Baltimore Chapter of [Maptime](maptime.io)! Our mission is to open the doors of cartographic possibility to anyone interested by creating a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation using mapping tools and technologies.

Find us on [**Meetup**](https://www.meetup.com/maptime_bmore/) and get to know other mappers in the Baltimore area.

We are supported by [Fearless](https://fearless.tech/), a full stack digital services firm in Baltimore. Please reach out through [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/maptime_bmore/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaptimeBmore) if you would like to help support MaptimeBmore through sponsorship of our Meetup.com fees, or by hosting/sponsoring an event.
